Topic (Title):
Defeat Space Invaders with AI!

High level description of project: 
Reinforcement learning is the future. Developing reinforcement learning models using video games is a great strategy that reduces costs by learning in an environment that can do no damage. An example of training in a real-life environment would be using a reinforcement learning model with a robot in a warehouse stacking boxes. If the model makes a mistake, boxes or even the warehouse itself could be damaged. Starting small, I would like to create a reinforcement learning model to play a simple game of space invaders. The business use for a model like this would be to implement it in future games; an enemy or ally that does not just run “on tracks” provides more enjoyment, and hopefully will provide a better experience.

Data Source(s): 
None

What I’ll Use:
In this article, the authors were able to create a model that learned to play a simple game in “just 5 minutes of training”.
